A fresher, computer-nerd from DIU who is passionate about Linux, Free (*as in Freedom*), and open-source software.<br>

Aspire to become Linux System Administrator and later, get into infosec. I have experience in Debian and Arch-based Linux environments from the personal computer. My final year research was on a brief security analysis of MQTT, an IoT networking protocol.
