A fresher, computer-nerd from DIU who is passionate about Linux, Free (as in Freedom), and open-source software.<br> 
I love working in a Linux environment, for which I love learning about hardware and systems.

Aspire to become Linux System Administrator and get into infosec later. I have experience in Debian and Arch-based Linux environments from the personal computer. My final year research was on a brief security analysis of MQTT, an IoT networking protocol.

- ðŸŒ± Currently, learning about Manual & Automation testing for SQA.<br>
- ðŸ›  Sharpening my skills on Linux & Networking.<br>
- âœ¨ Looking for opportunities to grow.
