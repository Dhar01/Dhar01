### ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone, I'm Loknath Dhar, a Linux Enthusiast

A fresher, computer-nerd from DIU who is passionate about Linux, Free (as in Freedom), and open-source software.<br> 
I love working in a Linux environment, for which I love learning about hardware and systems.

Aspire to become Linux System Administrator and get into infosec later. I have experience in Debian and Arch-based Linux environments from the personal computer. My final year research was on a brief security analysis of MQTT, an IoT networking protocol.
